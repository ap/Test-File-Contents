Revision history for Test-File-Contents

0.10  2011-02-18
      - Maintainership taken by David E. Wheeler.
      - Removed `examples/simple.pl`, since it wouldn't run anyway.
      - Added prototypes to the test functions.
      - Failure diagnostics now appear after the failure message, rather than
        before.
      - Renamed `file_contents_is` and `file_contents_isnt` to
        `file_contents_eq` and `file_contents_ne`, respectively. The old names
        remain as aliases for backwards compatibility.
      - Reworked default test descriptions to include the names of the files
        being tested.
      - Wordsmithed some of the diagnostic messages.
